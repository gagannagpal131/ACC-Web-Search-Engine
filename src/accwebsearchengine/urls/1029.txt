The House on Riverside, located at 2629 Riverside Drive West (corner of Patricia and Riverside Drive), is the Psychological Services and Research Centre's new home at the University of Windsor. For more than 40 years, the PSRC has been running as part of the Psychology Administrative Academic Unit (AAU) and it continues to be a core resource for our graduate program in clinical psychology accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association. The PSRC is essentially an analogue of what a teaching hospital is to a medical school. It is an advanced training facility for graduate students in the Clinical Psychology Program at the University of Windsor. Low-cost psychological services are provided by clinical trainees under the supervision clinical psychologists from the Department of Psychology, all of whom are registered with the College of Psychologists of Ontario. The mission of the PSRC is threefold: to provide gold standard clinical training, contingent on training priorities, to provide psychological services to University of Windsor students and to larger the Windsor community, and to generate applied research opportunities for faculty and students in the Department of Psychology.
