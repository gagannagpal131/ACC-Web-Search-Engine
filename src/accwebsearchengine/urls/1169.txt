We’re proud to be one of the few schools to offer clinical placements in the first year. During your four-year BScN education you will enjoy an abundance of hands-on learning opportunities during clinical placements in hospital and community settings, in the lab, and with simulation exercises. The Faculty of Nursing at the University of Windsor is partnered with more than 250 agencies throughout southwestern Ontario and is a leading nursing education institution that is making research for quality healthcare a high priority. More than 90% of nursing students in 2017 passed the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) on their first attempt. In 2018, 95.8% passed the NCLEX by the end of the year in which they graduated. This is because students receive outstanding instruction from award-winning professors dedicated to student success. At an undergraduate level, students are engaged in professional development activities stemming from current research initiatives and best practices in nursing. Graduates are qualified to practice in both Canada and the United States, and can pursue further studies. Explore Programs Explore UWindsor's Campus Visit the Toldo Health Education Centre The Toldo Health Education Centre is home to the Faculty of Nursing. Its "smart" classrooms have high-tech capabilities and their state-of-the-art clinic is where students can practice their skills on computerized mannequins, who breathe and respond to treatment and medication - like a real person. The adjoining Dr. Murray O'Neil Medical Education Building houses the Windsor Program of the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. It provides future doctors with fully interactive lecture theatres and anatomy labs.
