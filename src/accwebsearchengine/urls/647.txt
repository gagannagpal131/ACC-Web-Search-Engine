Now she is heading up a law clinic — the first of its kind in North America — dedicated one of the most high-profile and far-reaching legal procedures in the Canadian justice system. The Class Action Clinic at Windsor Law will focus on class members: people who are part of a large civil lawsuit launched on their behalf by representative plaintiffs and class counsel. With start-up funding from The Law Foundation of Ontario, it is staffed by Kalajdzic as the clinic director overseeing a team of students who will provide summary advice, assistance with filing claims in settlement distribution processes, and representation in court proceedings. “The ultimate objective of the clinic is to provide substantive access to justice to class members and in doing so, better fulfill the access to justice promise of the class action regime,” says Kalajdzic. “Class counsel do not have a traditional lawyer-client relationship with class members, as a matter of law and practicality. The Class Action Clinic will provide legal support to this unique group of litigants.” The clinic announcement was featured on the University of Windsor's Daily News, CBC Radio-Canada, Law Times, The Lawyer's Daily, AM800, Blackburn News, the Windsor Star and Lerners.ca.
