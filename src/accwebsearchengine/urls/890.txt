EPICentre serves as the hub for all entrepreneurial activity on the University of Windsor campus. From extra-curricular activities to workshop series, students from all disciplines have the opportunity to explore entrepreneurship. We also provide mentorship, co-working space and access to funding to students and recent graduates interested to start and grow their businesses. History EPICentre was launched in 2014 as a university-wide campus-linked accelerator with a significant grant from the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Employment and the University of Windsor’s investment in the state-of-the-art innovation space on the 2nd floor of the Joyce Entrepreneurship Centre. EPICentre was a collaborative project between the Office of Research and Innovation Services and Odette School of Business to expand the previous entrepreneurship initiative from the Odette School of Business, Centre for Enterprise and Law to the entire campus. The initiative was led by Dr Francine Schlosser (Professor at the Odette School of Business), Heather Pratt (Executive Director, Office of Research and Innovation Services), Nicole Anderson (formerly Learning Specialist, Odette School of Business) and Wen Teoh (formerly Research and Commercialization Associate, Office of Research and Innovation Services) who subsequently became the founding team of EPICentre.
