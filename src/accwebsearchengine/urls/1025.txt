Campus Pride Centre The Campus Pride Centre provides a positive environment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer, Questioning, Two-Spirited, Intersex, Pansexual and Asexual individuals and their allies on the University of Windsor campus. Health and Dental Plan The UWSA, on behalf of its members, negotiates a health and dental plan for those students who are not already covered. This service is provided for students in order to reduce the costs of a benefit plan for students that are not already covered. Peer Support Centre The Peer Support Centre is a drop-in centre where students from across campus can find a supportive peer to talk to. It’s a safe and inclusive space where trained peer support volunteers offer peer counselling to students. Scholarships Every year, the UWSA offers up to $10,000 in scholarships and bursaries. UWSA scholarships are given out based on academic performance, extracurricular activities or community involvement. All undergraduate students are encouraged to apply. Shinerama Shinerama is Canada’s largest post-secondary school fundraiser. Over 35,000 student volunteers from 60 Canadian universities and colleges across the country come together every year to make a difference in the lives of those battling cystic fibrosis (CF). Student Groups With more than 150 student clubs and societies on campus, each UWSA student group has a niche in our campus community. Also check out the UWSA Hub as it is the platform for all things related to student groups at the University of Windsor. Universal Bus Pass In 2016, the UWSA, OPUS and GSS negotiated a universal student bus pass (U-Pass) for UWSA, OPUS and GSS students. The U-Pass allows members to have unlimited rides on the regular Transit Windsor city service during the school year, ensuring affordable and accessible transportation throughout your academic journey.
