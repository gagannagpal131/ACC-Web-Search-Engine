Courses include Research Methods, a Graduate Seminar and Legal Theory. Students enrolled in the LLM with Certificate in University Teaching and Learning stream complete courses in law teaching, lecturing, course design and pedagogical assessment. An emphasis on rigorous scholarship centred on our institutional themes of Access to Justice and Transnational Law. An innovative experiential learning component that allows students in the LLM with Certificate in University Teaching and Learning stream to complete a certificate in university teaching, and to engage in law teaching during the course of their study. Windsor Law has earned distinction among law schools for its emphases on access to justice, community service and transnational law — and our faculty reflect this focus. Together, they form a vibrant intellectual and social community that provides our students with an appreciation of law as a vehicle for legal and social change.
