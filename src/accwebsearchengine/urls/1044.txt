Parents can help by maintaining a balance between supporting their students and allowing them to achieve a sense of independence. The University of Windsor's role is to provide information to both parents/family members and students to assist them in achieving this balance. The transition to university is almost always challenging for all involved. The dynamics of university life have changed considerably over the past decade. The parent website will help you to make sense of how these changes may affect you and your student; especially during the first year. This Parent Program is brought to you by the Student Success and Leadership Centre at the University of Windsor. share tweet save Show your son or daughter you are thinking of them!
