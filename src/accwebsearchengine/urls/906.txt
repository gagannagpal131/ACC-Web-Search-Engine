Maybe you have an idea for a new product or service, or something really innovative and unique. This program offers a wide variety of benefits – but most of all, it offers a chance for you to jump into something completely different and non-traditional. The most important skills you will gain in this program are the techniques to validate business ideas; which is a skill you can transfer into your next idea or even your future career. Benefits of the Discovery Program 1. Mentorship One of the main benefits of this program is getting a chance to receive one-on-one mentorship from successful leaders who have started their own business. They will provide you with great insight on how to get started, who to connect with, and how to align your strategic goals with what you want to accomplish. “The Discovery program’s focus is to help students from any faculty to further validate an idea through mentorship, research and defining the problem. It’s meant to help you come away with the fundamental knowledge on what the process is to develop the idea and build it to fruition in order to succeed.” – David Kirby, EPICentre Mentor “I love being involved with the students in the EPICentre Discovery program because they are so full of wonderful ideas and many of them are focused on bettering society. It is seldom that their entrepreneurial ideas are solely about making money and I love helping them to understand that they can do good things and have a successful business as well.” – Maureen Lucas, EPICentre Mentor More information about our EPIC mentors can be found here. 2. Workshops & Events EPICentre hosts regular scheduled events for Discovery Members including: Workshops on how to conduct market research, conduct primary and secondary research, and how to effectively record and filter your research data; Networking events; Round table discussions; and Weekly meetups. 3. Access to our co-working space Once you become a member at EPICentre, you will have access to a “hot desk” – an on-demand workstation. You can use any of our designated hot desks during our regular business hours to work on your projects and business ideas. 4. Completion Certificate Once you complete the Discovery Program, eligible candidates will receive a Discovery Program certificate. 5. Co-Curricular Record If you’re a current student at the University of Windsor, you are eligible to receive a co-curricular record which helps to: Complement your resume and academic transcript with a documented list of experiences, validated by a UWindsor faculty/staff member; Showcase your skill development and leadership roles; Show your progression and participation in co-curricular activities throughout your UWindsor experience; and Encourage reflection on experiences and assist with the articulation of related learning.
