We know that a mature digital accessibility program must establish a sustainable organizational culture around accessibility. Core Beliefs At Blackboard, we believe in providing a more inclusive experience for everyone. To make sure we achieve this goal, our products and processes are guided by the following core beliefs: Accessibility is an Imperative—Not an Afterthought As inclusive thinking spreads across the education landscape, we have a unique opportunity to positively impact the lives of people with disabilities. To do so we must deeply integrate accessibility into all aspects of our organizational culture. Understand, Empathize & Act Teachers and students’ fundamental goals remain the same, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities. We must endeavour to fully understand the needs of people with disabilities. However, awareness is not enough. We must act. Deliver the Promise The edu-tech industry’s accessibility focus is rapidly increasing due to the tremendous promise technology offers to people with disabilities. We must focus on providing tools and services that deliver on this promise and inspire people of all abilities to learn.
