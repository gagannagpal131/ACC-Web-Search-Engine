Co-op and internship staff and UWindsor faculty members work closely to ensure that our programs are responsive to your needs. More than Just a Job! As a co-op student or student intern, you'll be provided with constant feedback on your strengths and weaknesses so that you can improve and develop throughout the program of study. While on a work term, you will submit learning objectives to identify which skills you want to develop on the job. You will participate in a work term assessment to give you feedback on your progress and to work with your supervisor to ensure your placement meets your expectations. You will gain presentation skills through preparing and delivering a post-work term presentation to an audience of your peers and enhance your writing skills through completing a written report. More importantly, you will make contacts and build your network which will help you find employment upon graduation. Professional Development Prior to graduating, co-op students and student interns must complete professional development activities designed to address relevant topics and to cultivate the skills which employers need. Activities range from attending workshops on resume writing, interview skills, report writing and presentation techniques. Individual Attention The co-op and internship programs are managed by teams which are comprised of a program co-op coordinator, employer relations co-op coordinator and internship coordinator. These individuals are committed to working with you in order to make your co-op and internship experience truly rewarding. Accreditation The University of Windsor is proud to note that our co-op degree programs are accredited by Co-operative Education and Work-Integrated Learning Canada (CEWIL). CEWIL's mission is to foster and advance post-secondary co-operative education and work-integrated learning in Canada. share tweet save Career-Ready Talent share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
