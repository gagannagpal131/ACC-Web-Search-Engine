These titles can be found in our library catalogue by searching for “Polonia Centre donation” (with quotations). The Polonia Centre in Windsor is our key contact in this partnership. The Library regularly partners with the Polonia Centre to celebrate Polish heritage in Windsor though displays and events during annual Polish Week activities.. Polonia Centre Windsor Polonia Centre Library Fund The money for the Polonia Centre Library Fund in Leddy Library was donated as a demonstration of gratitude of Polish Canadians to their adoptive country. It was a starting point of the Polonia Centre's "let's invest in knowledge" initiative in 2001.
