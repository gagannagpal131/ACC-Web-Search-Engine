Here in Canada’s southernmost city, the sun shines 2,261 hours each year. Among the trails that wind through the area is a five-kilometre path along the waterfront for cycling or jogging. If nightlife is your thing, the music scene is hot, and we’re home to the Windsor International Film Festival and some of the best shopping around. Detroit is right across the river with its major league sports, big-name concerts and art galleries. Windsor is one of the most diverse cities in Canada with great restaurants to match. Think bubble tea, shawarma and award-winning pizza out of a wood-fired oven. Every student gets a Transit Windsor bus pass so you can easily make your way around. Our campus sits on the traditional territory of the Three Fires Confederacy of First Nations, comprised of the Ojibwa, the Odawa, and the Potawatomi. We acknowledge that there are few places on earth that someone before us has not called home.
